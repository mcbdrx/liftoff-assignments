# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide feedback and direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline, or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview

I would like to make a garden planning web application that also has the ability to give users information about what plants need to thrive,
and companion plants that will help ward off certain pests. Some things it will be able to do is allow users to specify which plants they'd
like to grow, how many they'd like to grow, their gardening zone, and possibly where they want each plant located in their yard. It will tell
users how many weeks ahead to start germinating seedlings, when it's okay to move them outside, recommended spacing for each plant, how many
hours of sunlight a specific plant will need, how much water a plant will need, and a plant's recommended temperature to grow. I would like to
include an ability to visually map out how a user would like to position each plant according to the layout of their yard (like an interactive
floor plan), but I recognize that this may not be possible to get done before the end of class, so it isn't a priority.

### Features

This project will include user login and sign-up with password hashing, search ability to make a list of plants that a user plans to grow with the ability to cross them
off (and if a plant doesn't grow well in the user's grow zone, it will alert them but still allow them to add it to their list), a page for each
type of plant that gives brief details about what conditions the plant does best in, a nonspecific to-do list for user's to keep track of individual
tasks, notes/tips written by the user to help plan for future gardening (such as "Tomatoes did best with 'x' type of fertilizer"), and possibly an
interactive floor plan that represents a user's back and/or front yard that allows them to plan how plants will be placed.

### Technologies

Java (IntelliJ)
MySQL (MAMP)
Thymeleaf
Spring Boot
HTML5
CSS
Bootstrap


### What I'll Have to Learn

Delving deeper into the technologies that we covered in class, and if I include the interactive floor plan, I will have to figure out a way to use that.
